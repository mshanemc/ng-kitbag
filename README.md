### ng-kitbag

This contains items adapated from the following:

* AngularJS (Google)
* Angular-UI-Bootstrap (bootstrapp-themed angular directives for common UI components)
* ngForce (Kevin Poorman)
* Bootstrap CSS (formerly Twitter)
* the Salesforce Foundation S1-flavored bootstrap theme
* a namespaced version of bootstrap that avoids collision with native Salesforce desktop styling
* Salesforce streaming API implementation

cdn includes for

* lodash
* momentjs

It will expand and update as my needs change.

This project is for building out demos and POCs quickly.  I would be hesitant to use it in production, but it might be a good place to start (or fork from) to make your own.
